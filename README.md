## âœ¨ Features
- **Privacy-Focused**: All processing is done locallyâ€”no cloud dependency.
- **PDF Support**: Upload one or more PDF documents for querying.
- **Customizable**: Modify prompts to tailor the assistantâ€™s behavior.
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly chat interface powered by **Streamlit**.
